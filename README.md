**Negy is a proxy that hides the routing of HTTP requests in a similar way to Tor; through Negy's network, websites have no way of identifying who has accessed them at the network level. It is possible to try Negy with the following commands.**

```bash
curl https://example.com -x http://gateway.negy.io
```

## Features

- :white_check_mark: Secure routing
- :white_check_mark: Configure as proxy
- :white_check_mark: High portability
- :white_check_mark: Fault tolerance

## Contribution

User contributions are needed to stabilise the network. Users who can afford public computing resources are encouraged to join the Negy network. You can join with a single command. [Here](https://negy.io/docs/contribution/launch_public_node) describes how to do it.
